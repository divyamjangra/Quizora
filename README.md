## INTRODUCTION:

QUIZORA is an intelligent and interactive web-based quiz platform designed to transform traditional learning into an engaging, personalized experience. It combines adaptive technology, real-time feedback, and a variety of question types to help users test, learn, and grow with every quiz attempt.

The platform supports multiple-choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, and multimedia-based questions. It includes an AI-driven adaptive mode that adjusts difficulty based on user performance, as well as a multiplayer feature that adds a fun, competitive edge to collaborative learning.

QUIZORA is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and intuitive frontend, enhanced by Bootstrap for design consistency and mobile responsiveness. The backend is powered by Node.js, while Firebase is used for real-time database integration, user authentication, and secure data storage—ensuring scalability and seamless synchronization across users.

Developed as part of the Source Code Management (SCM) curriculum, this project demonstrates effective use of Git for version control, including structured branching, consistent commit practices, and release tagging. The development workflow models real-world collaboration and deployment strategies, making QUIZORA both a technical project and a learning journey in itself.

QUIZORA is more than just a quiz app—it’s a dynamic learning ecosystem built to adapt, engage, and evolve with its users.
